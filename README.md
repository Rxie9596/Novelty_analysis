# Novelty Analysis
Matlab and Python code for novelty exploration behavior analysis in mice.
Used after [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/AlexEMG/DeepLabCut) and MoSeq analysis.

## Scripts for DeepLabCut data analysis

#### Basic data analysis
0. Edit configuration file 
```
Config_NovAna.m
```

Especially, use correct `networkname_format`, which is the network name after 'DeepLabCut' without extension. For example `DeepCut_resnet50_MoSeqNoveltySep12shuffle1_1030000`

Use correct `videoname_format`, an example file name of your videos, including the '.mp4' or '.avi' extensions. For example, `C4_180907_rgb.mp4`

* The following code need to be run directly under the folder containing all the videos and `.csv` files, if the videos are placed under subfolders use:`MoveFromDir.m`

1. Mannually label the position of the arena and object, using 
```
MarkObjPos.m
```
2. Calculate head position, speed, angle etc. Also plotting the trajectory, heatmap, etc. 
```
Analysis.m
```
3. Make labeled videos to check whether the labels are correct. This script generate labeled videos with a side bar showing the frame number, distance, orientation, speed, etc. for mannually label some interesting behaviors.
```
VideoLabeling.m
```
#### Further data analysis
* Code for calculating and plotting the time spent around the object / orienting towards the object.
```
TimeStatistic.m
Plot_compare.m
```

* Code for calculating and plotting the time spent at different distances to the object per unit area.
```
DistHistPerUnitArea
```
* Code for event-based analyses, calculating and plotting several parameters, including number of interaction, time spent interacting with object, time per interaction, body length index, retreat speed, approach-retreat angle, etc.
```
EventBasedAnalysis.m
```

* Code for finding poking behavior in stimulus novelty mice.
```
FindingPokeDTW.m
```

## Scripts for MoSeq data analysis
0. If necessary, split the RGB videos from the raw data generated by MoSeq.
```
MoSeqMoveRGB.m
```

1. Transfer the data generated by MoSeq to MATLAB readable format.
```
ModelDataTransfer.py
```
Run this code in the `moseq2` conda enviroment and under the directory `Novelty_analysis/MoSeqAnalysis`, specify the path of the index file and model file, for example
```
index_file = '/media/alex/DataDrive1/MoSeqData/CvsS_180831/CvsS_20180831_MoSeq/moseq2-index.yaml'
model_file = '/media/alex/DataDrive1/MoSeqData/CvsS_180831/CvsS_20180831_MoSeq/my_model.p'
```
Also specify where you would like to save the out put file, for example,
```
save_directory='/home/alex/Desktop/MoSeqDataFrame.mat'
```

* if you are doing fiber phtotmetry with MoSeq, run the following code to transfer the fiber phtotmetry data to MATLAB readable format.
```
FPDataTransfer.py
```
ALso remember to specify the input and output directory.
```
save_directory='/home/alex/Desktop/MoSeqFP.mat'
filename = '/media/alex/DataDrive1/MoSeqData/MSFP_Test/180922/session_20180922154525/nidaq.dat'
nch=3
```
`nch` is the number of channels plus 1 (timestamps) of your photometry recording.

2. Edit mice index file for further analysis, you can find a template here
```
Mice_Index_Template.m
```
In the following scripts, mice indexes and date indexes are read as specified in this file, please also spcify where to find this mice index file in later analyses.

3. Make labeled videos which show the syllables numbers and a color bar in the bottom which shows the syllables being used.
```
MoSeqVideoLabeling.m
```

4. Calculate and plot general syllable usage and conpare syllable expression of several different groups.
```
MoSeqGeneralSyllableAnalysis.m
```
Remember to spcify the mice and dates of each group. For example, G1 is contextual novelty mice, and G2 is stimulus novelty mice.
```
G1_Mice=[1 2 3 4];
G2_Mice=[5 6 7 8];
G1_Days=[3 4 5 6];
G2_Days=[3 4 5 6];

% G3 Base line
G3_Mice=1:8;
G3_Days=[1 2];
```
The results are sorted by `(G2-G1)/(G2+G1)`, so on the left hand side are G2 enriched syllables and on the right hand side are G1 enriched syllables.

5. Structure clusting of syllables,
```
MoSeqSyllableClustering.m
```

6. Plot the positions of interesting syllables.
```
MoSeqSyllablePos.m
```
Specify which syllable you would like to plot by setting `IntSyllable`
 
7. Calculate and plot the syllable expression at different distance to the object.
```
MoSeqSyllableDisToObj.m
```

8. Analyze general syllable transition,
```
MoSeqGeneralTransition.m
```
Remember to spcify the mice and dates of each group. 

9. Analyze transitions around an interesting syllable.
```
MoSeqInterestingNodeTransition.m
```
Remember to spcify the mice and dates of each group. Also specify which syllable you are interested in by setting, for example
```
IntNode='70';
```

10. Calculate syllable usage around human labels of an interesting behavior.
```
MoSeqEventAlignedAnalysis.m
```

11. Calculate syllable usage across trials, across days
```
MoSeqEventBasedAnalysis.m
```

* Scripts for sychronizing photometry data,
```
MoSeqFiberPhotometry.m
```
